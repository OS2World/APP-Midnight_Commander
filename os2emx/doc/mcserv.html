<H2>NAME</H2>
       mcserv - Midnight Commander file server.

<H2>USAGE</H2>
       <b>mcserv</b> [-diqvf] [-p portnum]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       mcserv  is  the  server program for the Midnight Commander
       networking file system.  It provides access  to  the  host
       file  system  to  clients running the Midnight file system
       (currently, only the Midnight Commander file manager).

       If the program is run as root the program will try to  get
       a reserved port otherwise it will use 9876 as the port.

       If the system has a portmapper running, then the port will
       be registered with the portmapper and  thus  clients  will
       automatically  connect  to  the right port.  If the system
       does not have a portmapper, then a port should be manually
       specified with the -p option (see below).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       <i>-d</i>     Become  a  daemon,  you should use this flag if you
              start the program from one of  the  system  startup
              files.   This flag will make the program handle any
              number of incoming requests by forking a  new  copy
              of itself for each client.

       <i>-q</i>     Quiet mode.

       <i>-p</i>     To  make the server listen on the specified <b>portnum</b>
              port.

       <i>-f</i>     Force ftp authorization if classic fails.  This  is
              only  useful  on  systems  whose  password checking
              method is not supported by this version of  mcserv.
              Authorization  is then done by trying to connect to
              the local ftp server and supplying  user  name  and
              password. Ftp server then says whether are you suc-
              cessfuly logged in or whether  you  typed  a  wrong
              password.  Use  this with care and only when neces-
              sary.

       <i>-v</i>     Toggle on the verbose mode.

<H2>BUGS</H2>
       This  program  currently  uses port 9876, and not a system

       secure port.  This is a potential security  problem  since
       it  could  be  run by any user on the system if the system
       daemon is not running.
