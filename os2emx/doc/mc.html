<H2>NAME</H2>
       mc - Visual shell for Unix-like systems.

<H2>USAGE</H2>
       <b>mc</b> [-abcCdfhPstuUVx?] [-l log] [dir1 [dir2]] [-v file]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       The Midnight Commander is a directory browser/file manager
       for Unix-like operating systems.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       <i>-a</i>     Disables the usage of graphic characters  for  line
              drawing.

       <i>-b</i>     Forces black and white display.

       <i>-c</i>     Force  color  mode, please check the section Colors
              for more information.

       <i>-C</i> <i>arg</i> Used to specify a different color set in  the  com-
              mand  line.  The format of arg is documented in the
              Colors section.

       <i>-d</i>     Disables mouse support.

       <i>-f</i>     Displays the compiled-in search paths for  Midnight
              Commander files.

       <i>-k</i>     Reset  softkeys  to  their  default  from the term-
              cap/terminfo database. Only useful on HP  terminals
              when the function keys don't work.

       <i>-l</i> <i>file</i>
              Save the ftpfs dialog with the server in file.

       <i>-P</i>     At  program  end, the Midnight Commander will print
              the last working directory; this,  along  with  the
              shell  function  below,  will  allow  you to browse
              through your directories and automatically move  to
              the  last  directory  you were in (thanks to Torben
              Fjerdingstad and Sergey for contributing this func-
              tion and the code which implements this option).

              bash and zsh users:

              mc ()
              {
                      MC=/tmp/mc$$-"$RANDOM"
                      @prefix@/bin/mc -P "$@" &gt; "$MC"
                      cd "`cat $MC`"
                      rm "$MC"
                      unset MC;
              }

                         20 October 1997                        1

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

              tcsh users:
              alias mc 'setenv MC `@prefix@/bin/mc -P *`; cd $MC; unsetenv MC'

       I  know  the  bash function could be shorter for zsh and
              bash but the
              backquotes on bash won't accept your suspension the
              program with C-z.

       <i>-s</i>     Turns on the slow terminal mode, in this  mode  the
              program  will not draw expensive line drawing char-
              acters and will toggle verbose mode off.

       <i>-t</i>     Used only if the code was compiled with  Slang  and
              terminfo:  it  makes the Midnight Commander use the
              value of the  <b>TERMCAP</b>  variable  for  the  terminal
              information  instead of the information on the sys-
              tem wide terminal database

       <i>-u</i>     Disables the use of a concurrent shell (only  makes
              sense if the Midnight Commander has been built with
              concurrent shell support).

       <i>-U</i>     Enables the use of  the  concurrent  shell  support
              (only  makes  sense  if  the Midnight Commander was
              built with the subshell support set as an  optional
              feature).

       <i>-v</i> <i>file</i>
              Enters  the internal viewer to view the file speci-
              fied.

       <i>-V</i>     Displays the version of the program.

       <i>-x</i>     Forces xterm mode.  Used  when  running  on  xterm-
              capable  terminals  (two  screen modes, and able to
              send mouse escape sequences).

       If specified, the first path name is the directory to show
       in  the selected panel; the second path name is the direc-
       tory to be shown in the other panel.

Overview
       The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into  four
       parts.  Almost  all of the screen space is taken up by two
       directory panels.  By default, the second bottommost  line
       of  the  screen  is the shell command line, and the bottom
       line shows the function key labels. The  topmost  line  is
       the  menu bar line.  The menu bar line may not be visible,
       but appears if you click the topmost line with  the  mouse
       or press the F9 key.

       The  Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories
       at the same time. One of the panels is the  current  panel

                         20 October 1997                        2

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       (a  selection  bar  is  in  the current panel). Almost all
       operations take place on  the  current  panel.  Some  file
       operations  like Rename and Copy by default use the direc-
       tory of the  unselected  panel  as  a  destination  (don't
       worry,  they  always  ask you for confirmation first). For
       more information, see the sections on the  Directory  Pan-
       els, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.

       You  can execute system commands from the Midnight Comman-
       der by simply typing them. Everything you type will appear
       on  the  shell  command line, and when you press Enter the
       Midnight Commander  will  execute  the  command  line  you
       typed;  read  the  Shell  Command Line and Input Line Keys
       sections to learn more about the command line.

Mouse Support
       The Midnight Commander comes with mouse  support.   It  is
       activated whenever you are running on an <b><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?xterm+1">xterm(1)</A></b> terminal
       (it even works if you take a telnet or  rlogin  connection
       to  another  machine from the xterm) or if you are running
       on a Linux console and have the <b>gpm</b> mouse server  running.

       When  you  left  click  on a file in the directory panels,
       that file is selected; if you click with the right button,
       the file is marked (or unmarked, depending on the previous
       state).

       Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the  command
       if  it is an executable program; and if the extension file
       has a program specified  for  the  file's  extension,  the
       specified program is executed.

       Also,  it  is possible to execute the commands assigned to
       the function key labels by clicking on them.

       If a mouse button is clicked on the top frame line of  the
       directory panel, it is scrolled one pageful backward. Cor-
       respondingly, a click on the bottom frame line will  cause
       a  scroll  of  one pageful forward. This frame line method
       works also in the Help Viewer and the Directory Tree.

       The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is  400
       milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by edit-
       ing the ~/.mc/ini file and changing the  <i>mouse</i><b>_</b><i>repeat</i><b>_</b><i>rate</i>
       parameter.

       If  you  are running the Commander with the mouse support,
       you can bypass the Commander and  get  the  default  mouse
       behavior  (cutting  and  pasting text) by holding down the
       Shift key.

Keys
       Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of
       the  <i>Control</i>  (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the <i>Meta</i>
       (sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this man-
       ual we will use the following abbreviations:

       C-&lt;chr&gt;  means hold the Control key while typing the char-
       acter &lt;chr&gt;. Thus C-f would be: hold the Control  key  and
       type f.

       M-&lt;chr&gt;  means  hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing
       &lt;chr&gt;. If there is no Meta or Alt key, type  ESC,  release
       it, then type the character &lt;chr&gt;.

       All  input lines in the Midnight Commander use an approxi-
       mation to the GNU Emacs editor's key bindings.

       There are many sections which tell  about  the  keys.  The
       following are the most important.

       The File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for
       the commands appearing in  the  File  menu.  This  section
       includes the function keys. Most of these commands perform
       some action, usually on the selected file  or  the  tagged
       files.

       The  Directory  Panels  section  documents  the keys which
       select a file or tag files as a target for a later  action
       (the action is usually one from the file menu).

       The  Shell  Command  Line  section list the keys which are
       used for entering and editing command lines. Most of these
       copy  file names and such from the directory panels to the
       command line (to avoid excessive  typing)  or  access  the
       command line history.

       Input  Line  Keys  are  used for editing input lines. This
       means both the command line and the  input  lines  in  the
       query dialogs.

  <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Keys</b>
       Here  are some keys which don't fall into any of the other
       categories:

       <b>Enter.</b>  If there is some text in the command line (the one
       at  the  bottom  of the panels), then that command is exe-
       cuted. If there is no text in the command line then if the
       selection  bar  is over a directory the Midnight Commander
       does a <b><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?chdir+2">chdir(2)</A></b> to the selected directory and reloads  the
       information  on  the  panel;  if  the selection is an exe-
       cutable file then it is executed. Finally, if  the  exten-
       sion  of  the selected file name matches one of the exten-
       sions  in  the  extensions  file  then  the  corresponding

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       command is executed.

       <b>C-l.</b>   Repaint all the information in the Midnight Comman-
       der.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>c.</b>  Run the Chmod command on a file or on  the  tagged
       files.

       <b>C-x</b>  <b>o.</b>   Run  the Chown command on the current file or on
       the tagged files.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>l.</b>  Run the link command.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>s.</b>  Run the symbolic link command.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>i.</b>  Set the other panel display mode to information.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>q.</b>  Set the other panel display mode to quick view.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>!.</b>  Execute the External panelize command.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>h</b> Run the add directory to hotlist command.

       <b>M-!,</b> Executes the Filtered view command, described in  the
       view command.

       <b>M-?,</b> Executes the Find file command.

       <b>M-c,</b> Pops up the quick cd dialog.

       <b>C-o,</b>  When  the  program  is being run in the Linux or SCO
       console or under an xterm, it will show you the output  of
       the  previous command.  When ran on the Linux console, the
       Midnight Commander uses an external  program  (cons.saver)
       to  handle  saving  and  restoring  of  information on the
       screen.

       When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o
       at  any  time  and  you will be taken back to the Midnight
       Commander main screen, to return to your application  just
       type  C-o.   If you have an application suspended by using
       this trick, you won't be able to  execute  other  programs
       from  the  Midnight Commander until you terminate the sus-
       pended application.

  <b>Directory</b> <b>Panels</b>
       This section lists the keys which operate on the directory
       panels.  If  you want to know how to change the appearance
       of the panels take a look at the section on Left and Right
       Menus.

       <b>Tab,</b>  <b>C-i.</b>   Change the current panel. The old other panel
       becomes the new current panel and the  old  current  panel

                         20 October 1997                        5

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       becomes  the new other panel. The selection bar moves from
       the old current panel to the new current panel.

       <b>Insert,</b> <b>C-t.</b>  To tag files you may use the Insert key (the
       kich1  terminfo sequence) or the C-t (Control-t) sequence.
       To untag files, just retag a tagged file.

       <b>M-g,</b> <b>M-h</b> <b>(or</b> <b>M-r),</b> <b>M-j.</b>  Used to select the top file in  a
       panel, the middle file and the bottom one, respectively.

       <b>C-s,</b>  <b>M-s.</b>  Start a filename search in the directory list-
       ing. When the search is  active  the  keypresses  will  be
       added to the search string instead of the command line. If
       the <i>Show</i> <i>mini-status</i> option is enabled the  search  string
       is  shown on the mini-status line. When typing, the selec-
       tion bar will move to the  next  file  starting  with  the
       typed  letters.  The  <i>backspace</i> <i>or</i> <i>DEL</i> keys can be used to
       correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the next
       match is searched for.

       <b>M-t</b>  Toggle  the  current display listing to show the next
       display listing mode.  With this it is possible to quickly
       switch  from  long listing to regular listing and the user
       defined listing mode.

       <b>C-\</b> <b>(control-backslash).</b>  Show the directory  hotlist  and
       change to the selected directory.

       <b>+</b>  <b>(plus).</b>  This is used to select (tag) a group of files.
       The Midnight Commander will prompt for a  regular  expres-
       sion   describing  the  group.  When  <i>Shell</i>  <i>Patterns</i>  are
       enabled, the regular expression is much like  the  regular
       expressions  in  the  shell  (*  standing for zero or more
       characters and ?  standing for one  character).  If  <i>Shell</i>
       <i>Patterns</i>  is  off,  then the tagging of files is done with
       normal regular expressions (see ed (1)).

       If the expression starts or ends with a slash (/), then it
       will select directories instead of files.

       <b>\</b>  <b>(backslash).</b>   Use  the  "\" key to unselect a group of
       files. This is the opposite of the Plus key.

       <b>up-key,</b> <b>C-p.</b>  Move the selection bar to the previous entry
       in the panel.

       <b>down-key,</b>  <b>C-n.</b>   Move the selection bar to the next entry
       in the panel.

       <b>home,</b> <b>a1,</b> <b>M-&lt;.</b>  Move the selection bar to the first  entry
       in the panel.

       <b>end,</b> <b>c1,</b> <b>M-&gt;.</b>  Move the selection bar to the last entry in
       the panel.

       <b>next-page,</b> <b>C-v.</b>  Move the selection bar one page down.

       <b>prev-page,</b> <b>M-v.</b>  Move the selection bar one page up.

       <b>M-o,</b> If the other panel is a listing  panel  and  you  are
       standing  on  a  directory  in the current panel, then the
       other panel contents are set to the contents of  the  cur-
       rently selected directory (like Emacs' dired C-o key) oth-
       erwise the other panel contents are set to the parent  dir
       of the current dir.

       <b>C-PageUp,</b>  <b>C-PageDown</b>  Only when ran on the Linux console:
       does a chdir to ".." and to the currently selected  direc-
       tory respectively.

       <b>M-y</b> Moves to the previous directory in the history, equiv-
       alent to depressing the '&lt;' with the mouse.

       <b>M-u</b> Moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent
       to depressing the '&gt;' with the mouse.  Displays the direc-
       tory history, equivalent to depressing the  'v'  with  the
       mouse.

  <b>Shell</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b>
       This  section  lists keys which are useful to avoid exces-
       sive typing when entering shell commands.

       <b>M-Enter.</b>  Copy the currently selected  file  name  to  the
       command line.

       <b>C-Enter.</b>  Same a M-Enter, this one only works on the Linux
       console.

       <b>M-Tab.</b>  Does the filename, command, variable, username and
       hostname completion for you.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>t,</b> <b>C-x</b> <b>C-t.</b>  Copy the tagged files (or if there are no
       tagged files, the selected file) of the current panel (C-x
       t) or of the other panel (C-x C-t) to the command line.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>p,</b> <b>C-x</b> <b>C-p.</b>  The first key sequence copies the current
       path name to the command line, and the second  one  copies
       the unselected panel's path name to the command line.

       <b>C-q.</b>   The  quote command can be used to insert characters
       that are otherwise interpreted by the  Midnight  Commander
       (like the '+' symbol)

       <b>M-p,</b>  <b>M-n.</b>   Use  these keys to browse through the command
       history. M-p takes you to the last entry, M-n takes you to
       the next one.

       <b>M-h.</b>  Displays the history for the current input line.

  <b>General</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>Keys</b>
       The  help  viewer,  the file viewer and the directory tree
       use common code to handle moving.  Therefore  they  accept
       exactly the same keys. Each of them also accepts some keys
       of its own.

       Other parts of the Midnight Commander use some of the same
       movement  keys,  so  this  section may be of use for those
       parts too.

       <b>Up,</b> <b>C-p.</b>  Moves one line backward.

       <b>Down,</b> <b>C-n.</b>  Moves one line forward.

       <b>Prev</b> <b>Page,</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Up,</b> <b>M-v.</b>  Moves one pageful backward.

       <b>Next</b> <b>Page,</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Down,</b> <b>C-v.</b>  Moves one pageful forward.

       <b>Home,</b> <b>A1.</b>  Moves to the beginning.

       <b>End,</b> <b>C1.</b>  Move to the end.

       The help viewer and the file viewer accept  the  following
       keys in addition the to ones mentioned above:

       <b>b,</b>  <b>C-b,</b>  <b>C-h,</b> <b>Backspace,</b> <b>Delete.</b>  Moves one pageful back-
       ward.

       <b>Space</b> <b>bar.</b>  Moves one pageful forward.

       <b>u,</b> <b>d.</b>  Moves one half of a page backward or forward.

       <b>g,</b> <b>G.</b>  Moves to the beginning or to the end.

  <b>Input</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Keys</b>
       The input lines (they are used for the  command  line  and
       for the query dialogs in the program) accept these keys:

       <b>C-a</b> puts the cursor at the beginning of line.

       <b>C-e</b> puts the cursor at the end of the line.

       <b>C-b,</b> <b>move-left</b> move the cursor one position left.

       <b>C-f,</b> <b>move-right</b> move the cursor one position right.

       <b>M-f</b> moves one word forward.

       <b>M-b</b> moves one word backward.

       <b>C-h,</b> <b>backspace</b> delete the previous character.

       <b>C-d,</b>  <b>Delete</b>  delete  the character in the point (over the

       <b>C-@</b> sets the mark for cutting.

       <b>C-w</b> copies the text between the cursor and the mark  to  a
       kill buffer and removes the text from the input line.

       <b>M-w</b>  copies  the text between the cursor and the mark to a
       kill buffer.

       <b>C-y</b> yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.

       <b>C-k</b> kills the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

       <b>M-p,</b> <b>M-n</b> Use these keys to browse through the command his-
       tory. M-p takes you to the last entry, M-n  takes  you  to
       the next one.

       <b>M-C-h,</b> <b>M-Backspace</b> delete one word backward.

       <b>M-Tab</b>  does  the filename, command, variable, username and
       hostname completion for you.

Menu Bar
       The menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click the  mouse
       on the top row of the screen. The menu bar has five menus:
       "Left", "File", "Command", "Options" and "Right".

       The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify  the  appear-
       ance of the left and right directory panels.

       The  File  Menu  lists  the actions you can perform on the
       currently selected file or the tagged files.

       The Command Menu lists the actions which are more  general
       and bear no relation to the currently selected file or the
       tagged files.

  <b>Left</b> <b>and</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Menus</b>
       The outlook of the directory panels can  be  changed  from
       the <b>Left</b> and <b>Right</b> menus.

    <b>Listing</b> <b>Mode...</b>
       The  listing  mode  view  is  used to display a listing of
       files, there are four different listing  modes  available:
       <b>Full,</b>  <b>Brief,</b>  <b>Long,</b>  and  <b>User.</b>   The full directory view
       shows the file name, the size of the file and the  modifi-
       cation time.

       The  brief  view  shows  only the file name and it has two

                         20 October 1997                        9

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       columns (therefore showing twice as many  files  as  other
       views).  The  long  view is similar to the output of <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>
       command. The long view takes the whole screen width.

       If you choose the "User" display format, then you have  to
       specify the display format.

       The user display format must start with a panel size spec-
       ifier.  This may be "half" or "full", and they  specify  a
       half screen panel and a full screen panel respectively.

       After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode
       on the panel, this is done by adding the number "2" to the
       user format string.

       After this you add the name of the fields with an optional
       size specifier.  This are the  available  fields  you  may
       display:

       <b>name,</b> displays the file name.

       <b>size,</b> displays the file size.

       <b>bsize,</b>  is an alternative form of the &lt;bf/size/ format. It
       displays the size of the files and for directories it just
       shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.

       <b>type,</b> displays a one character field type.  This character
       is a superset of what is displayed by ls with the -F flag.
       An asterisk for executable files, a slash for directories,
       an at-sign for links, an equal sign for sockets, a  hyphen
       for  character  devices,  a plus sign for block devices, a
       pipe for fifos, a tilde for symbolic links to  directories
       and  an  exclamation mark for stalled symlinks (links that
       point nowhere).

       <b>mtime,</b> file's last modification time.

       <b>atime,</b> file's last access time.

       <b>ctime,</b> file's creation time.

       <b>perm,</b> a string representing the current permission bits of
       the file.

       <b>mode,</b>  an  octal value with the current permission bits of
       the file.

       <b>nlink,</b> the number of links to the  file.   <b>ngid,</b>  the  GID
       (numeric).

       <b>nuid,</b> the UID (numeric).

       <b>owner,</b> the owner of the file.

                         20 October 1997                       10

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       <b>group,</b> the group of the file.

       <b>inode,</b> the inode of the file.

       Also  you may use these field names for arranging the dis-
       play:

       <b>space,</b> a space in the display format.

       <b>mark,</b> An asterisk if the file is tagged, a space  if  it's
       not.

       <b>|,</b>  This  character  is used to add a vertical line to the
       display format.

       To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you
       just  add a ':' and then the number of characters you want
       the field to have, if the number is followed by the symbol
       '+',  then  the  size specifies the minimum field size, if
       the program finds out that there  is  more  space  on  the
       screen, it will then expand this field.

       For example, the <b>Full</b> display corresponds to this format:

       half type,name,|,size,|,mtime

       And the <b>Long</b> display corresponds to this format:

       full
       perm,space,nlink,space,owner,space,group,space,size,space,
       mtime,space,name

       This is a nice user display format:

       half name,|,size:7,|,type,mode:3

       Panels may also be set to the following modes:

       <b>Info</b>   The  info  view  display information related to the
              currently selected file and if possible information
              about the current file system.

       <b>Tree</b>   The  tree  view  is  quite similar to the directory
              tree feature. See the section  about  it  for  more
              information.

       <b>Quick</b> <b>View</b>
              In  this  mode,  the panel will switch to a reduced
              viewer that displays the contents of the  currently
              selected  file,  if  you select the panel (with the
              tab key or the mouse), you will have access to  the
              usual viewer commands.

    <b>Sort</b> <b>Order...</b>
       The  eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modi-
       fication time, by access time, and  by  inode  information
       modification time, by size, by inode and unsorted.  In the
       Sort order dialog box you can choose the  sort  order  and
       you  may also specify if you want to sort in reverse order
       by checking the reverse box.

       By default directories are sorted before  files  but  this
       can be changed from the Options menu (option <b>Mix</b> <b>all</b> <b>files</b>
       ).

    <b>Filter...</b>
       The filter command allows you to specify a  shell  pattern
       (for  example  <b>*.tar.gz</b> ) which the files must match to be
       shown. Regardless of the filter pattern,  the  directories
       and  the  links  to  directories  are  always shown in the
       directory panel.

    <b>Reread</b>
       The reread command reload the list of files in the  direc-
       tory.  It  is  useful  if  other processes have created or
       removed files.  If you have  panelized  file  names  in  a
       panel  this  will reload the directory contents and remove
       the panelized information (See the section External panel-
       ize for more information).

  <b>File</b> <b>Menu</b>
       The  Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard
       shortcuts for commands appearing in  the  file  menu.  The
       escape  sequences  for the Fkeys are terminfo capabilities
       kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals without function  key  sup-
       port,  you  can achieve the same functionality by pressing
       the ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and
       0 (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).

       The  File menu has the following commands (keyboard short-
       cuts in parentheses):

       <b>Help</b> <b>(F1)</b>

       Invokes the built-in hypertext  help  viewer.  Inside  the
       help  viewer,  you  can use the Tab key to select the next
       link and the Enter key to follow that link. The keys Space
       and  Backspace  are used to move forward and backward in a
       help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted
       keys.

       <b>Menu</b> <b>(F2)</b>

       Invoke  the user menu.  The user menu provides an easy way

                         20 October 1997                       12

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       to provide users with a menu and add extra features to the
       Midnight Commander.

       <b>View</b> <b>(F3,</b> <b>Shift-F3)</b>

       View  the currently selected file. By default this invokes
       the Internal File Viewer but if the option  "Use  internal
       view" is off, it invokes an external file viewer specified
       by the <b>PAGER</b> environment variable. If <b>PAGER</b> is  undefined,
       the  "view"  command  is  invoked.   If  you  use Shift-F3
       instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any for-
       matting or pre processing to the file.

       <b>Filtered</b> <b>View</b> <b>(M-!)</b>

       this command prompts for a command and it's arguments (the
       argument defaults to the currently  selected  file  name),
       the output from such command is shown in the internal file
       viewer.

       <b>Edit</b> <b>(F4)</b>

       Currently it invokes the <b>vi</b> editor, or the  editor  speci-
       fied  in  the <b>EDITOR</b> environment variable, or the Internal
       File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.

       <b>Copy</b> <b>(F5)</b>

       Pop up an input dialog with destination that  defaults  to
       the  directory  in  the  non-selected panel and copies the
       currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there  is
       at  least  one  file tagged) to the directory specified by
       the user in the input dialog. During this process, you can
       press C-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details about
       source mask (which will be usually either  *  or  ^\(.*\)$
       depending  on  setting of Use shell patterns) and possible
       wildcards in the destination see Mask copy/rename.

       On some systems, it is possible to  do  the  copy  in  the
       background by clicking on the background button (or press-
       ing M-b in the dialog box).  The Background Jobs  is  used
       to control the background process.

       <b>Link</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>l)</b>

       Create a hard link to the current file.

       <b>SymLink</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>s)</b>

       Create  a  symbolic  link to the current file. To those of
       you who don't know what links are: creating a  link  to  a
       file  is  a bit like copying the file, but both the source
       filename and the destination filename represent  the  same
       file  image.  For example, if you edit one of these files,

                         20 October 1997                       13

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       all changes you make will appear in both files. Some  peo-
       ple call links aliases or shortcuts.

       A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there
       is no way of telling which one is the original  and  which
       is  the  link.  If you delete either one of them the other
       one is still intact. It is very difficult to  notice  that
       the  files  represent  the same image. Use hard links when
       you don't even want to know.

       A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original
       file. If the original file is deleted the symbolic link is
       useless. It is quite easy to notice that the files  repre-
       sent  the  same  image.  The  Midnight  Commander shows an
       "@"-sign in front of the file name if  it  is  a  symbolic
       link  to  somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a
       tilde (~)).  The original file which the link points to is
       shown  on  mini-status line if the <i>Show</i> <i>mini-status</i> option
       is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid  the
       confusion that can be caused by hard links.

       <b>Rename/Move</b> <b>(F6)</b>

       Pop  up  an input dialog that defaults to the directory in
       the non-selected panel and moves  the  currently  selected
       file  (or the tagged files if there is at least one tagged
       file) to the directory specified by the user in the  input
       dialog.  During  the  process, you can press C-c or ESC to
       abort the operation. For more details look at Copy  opera-
       tion above, most of the things are quite similar.

       On  some  systems,  it  is  possible to do the copy in the
       background by clicking on the background button (or press-
       ing M-b in the dialog box). The Background Jobs is used to
       control the background process.

       <b>Mkdir</b> <b>(F7)</b>

       Pop up an input dialog and creates  the  directory  speci-
       fied.

       <b>Delete</b> <b>(F8)</b>

       Delete  the currently selected file or the tagged files in
       the currently selected panel. During the process, you  can
       press C-c or ESC to abort the operation.

       <b>Quick</b>  <b>cd</b>  <b>(M-c)</b> Use the quick cd command if you have full
       command line and want to cd somewhere.

       <b>Select</b> <b>group</b> <b>(+)</b>

       This is used to select (tag) a group of  files.  The  Mid-
       night  Commander  will  prompt  for  a  regular expression

                         20 October 1997                       14

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       describing the group. When <i>Shell</i> <i>Patterns</i> are enabled, the
       regular  expression  is much like the filename globbing in
       the shell (* standing for zero or more  characters  and  ?
       standing  for  one  character).  If <i>Shell</i> <i>Patterns</i> is off,
       then the tagging of files  is  done  with  normal  regular
       expressions (see ed (1)).

       To  mark directories instead of files, the expression must
       start or end with a '/'.

       <b>Unselect</b> <b>group</b> <b>(\)</b>

       Used for unselecting a group of files. This is  the  oppo-
       site of the <i>Select</i> <i>group</i> command.

       <b>Quit</b> <b>(F10,</b> <b>Shift-F10)</b>

       Terminate  the Midnight Commander.  Shift-F10 is used when
       you want to quit and you  are  using  the  shell  wrapper.
       Shift-F10 will not take you to the last directory you vis-
       ited with the Midnight Commander, instead it will stay  at
       the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.

    <b>Quick</b> <b>cd</b>
       This command is useful if you have a full command line and
       want to cd somewhere without having to yank and paste  the
       command  line.  This command pops up a small dialog, where
       you enter everything you would enter after <b>cd</b> on the  com-
       mand  line and then you press enter. This features all the
       things that are already in the internal cd command.

  <b>Command</b> <b>Menu</b>
       The Directory tree command shows  a  tree  figure  of  the
       directories.

       The  Find file command allows you to search for a specific
       file. The "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of  the
       two directory panels.

       The  "Panels  on/off" command shows the output of the last
       shell command. This works only on xterm and on  Linux  and
       SCO console.

       The  Compare  directories  (C-x  d)  command  compares the
       directory panels with each other. You  can  then  use  the
       Copy  (F5) command to make the panels identical. There are
       three compare methods. The quick method compares only file
       size and file date. The thorough method makes a full byte-
       by-byte compare. The thorough method is not  available  if
       the machine does not support the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mmap+2">mmap(2)</A> system call.  The
       size-only compare method just compares the file sizes  and
       does  not  check  the  contents or the date times, it just

                         20 October 1997                       15

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       checks the file size.

       The Command history command shows a  list  of  typed  com-
       mands. The selected command is copied to the command line.
       The command history can also be accessed by typing M-p  or
       M-n.

       The  Directory hotlist (C-\) command makes changing of the
       current directory to often used directories faster.

       The External panelize allows you to  execute  an  external
       program,  and make the output of that program the contents
       of the current panel.

       Extension file edit command allows you to specify programs
       to  executed  when you try to execute, view, edit and do a
       bunch of other thing  on  files  with  certain  extensions
       (filename endings). The Menu file edit command may be used
       for editing the user menu (which appears by pressing  F2).

    <b>Directory</b> <b>Tree</b>
       The  Directory  Tree  command  shows  a tree figure of the
       directories. You can select a directory  from  the  figure
       and  the Midnight Commander will change to that directory.

       There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real  directory
       tree  command  is  available from Commands menu. The other
       way is to select tree view from the Left or Right menu.

       To get rid of long delays the Midnight  Commander  creates
       the tree figure by scanning only a small subset of all the
       directories. If the directory which you  want  to  see  is
       missing,  move  to  its parent directory and press C-r (or
       F2).

       You can use the following keys:

       General movement keys are accepted.

       <b>Enter.</b>  In the directory tree, exits  the  directory  tree
       and changes to this directory in the current panel. In the
       tree view, changes to this directory in  the  other  panel
       and stays in tree view mode in the current panel.

       <b>C-r,</b>  <b>F2</b>  <b>(Rescan).</b>   Rescan this directory. Use this when
       the tree figure is out of date: it is missing  subdirecto-
       ries  or  shows  some subdirectories which don't exist any
       more.

       <b>F3</b> <b>(Forget).</b>  Delete this directory from the tree  figure.
       Use  this  to  remove clutter from the figure. If you want
       the directory back to the tree figure press F2 in its par-
       ent directory.

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       <b>F4</b>  <b>(Static/Dynamic).</b>   Toggle between the dynamic naviga-
       tion mode (default) and the static navigation mode.

       In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and  Down
       keys  to  select  a  directory.  All known directories are
       shown.

       In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down
       keys  to  select a sibling directory, the Left key to move
       to the parent directory, and the Right key to  move  to  a
       child  directory.  Only  the  parent, sibling and children
       directories are shown, others are left out. The tree  fig-
       ure changes dynamically as you traverse.

       <b>F5</b> <b>(Copy).</b>  Copy the directory.

       <b>F6</b> <b>(RenMov).</b>  Move the directory.

       <b>F7</b> <b>(Mkdir).</b>  Make a new directory below this directory.

       <b>F8</b>  <b>(Delete).</b>  Delete this directory from the file system.

       <b>C-s,</b> <b>M-s.</b>  Search the next directory matching  the  search
       string. If there is no such directory these keys will move
       one line down.

       <b>C-h,</b> <b>Backspace.</b>  Delete the last character of  the  search
       string.

       <b>Any</b>  <b>other</b>  <b>character.</b>   Add  the  character to the search
       string and move to the next directory  which  starts  with
       these characters. In the tree view you must first activate
       the search mode by pressing  C-s.  The  search  string  is

    <b>Find</b> <b>File</b>
       The  Find  File feature first asks for the start directory
       for the search and the filename to  be  searched  for.  By
       pressing  the  Tree button you can select the start direc-
       tory from the directory tree figure.

       The contents field accepts regular expressions similar  to

                         20 October 1997                       17

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?egrep+1">egrep(1)</A>.  That means you have to escape characters with a
       special meaning to egrep with "\", e.g. if you search  for
       "strcmp (" you will have to input "strcmp \(" (without the
       double quotes).

       You can start the search by pressing the Ok button.   Dur-
       ing  the search you can stop from the Stop button and con-
       tinue from the Start button.

       You can browse the filelist with the  up  and  down  arrow
       keys. The Chdir button will change to the directory of the
       currently selected file. The Again button will ask for the
       parameters  for  a  new  search. The Quit button quits the
       search operation. The Panelize button will place the found
       files  to  the  current directory panel so that you can do
       additional operations on them (view,  copy,  move,  delete
       and  so  on). After panelizing you can press C-r to return
       to the normal file listing.

       It is possible to have a list of directories that the Find
       File  command  should skip during the search (for example,
       you may want to avoid searches on a  CDROM  or  on  a  NFS
       directory that is mounted across a slow link).

       Directories  to  be  skipped should be set on the variable
       <b>find_ignore_dirs</b> in the <b>Misc</b>  section  of  your  ~/.mc/ini
       file.

       Directory  components  should  be  separated with a colon,
       here is an example:

       [Misc]
       find_ignore_dirs=/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

       You may consider using the External panelize  command  for
       some  operations.  Find file command is for simple queries
       only, while using External panelize you can do as mysteri-
       ous searches as you would like.

    <b>External</b> <b>panelize</b>
       The  External  panelize  allows you to execute an external
       program, and make the output of that program the  contents
       of the current panel.

       For  example, if you want to manipulate in one of the pan-
       els all the symbolic links in the current  directory,  you
       can  use  external  panelization to run the following com-
       mand:

       find . -type l -print
       Upon command completion, the  directory  contents  of  the
       panel  will no longer be the directory listing of the cur-
       rent directory, but all the files that are symbolic links.

                         20 October 1997                       18

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       If  you  want  to panelize all of the files that have been
       downloaded from your ftp server, you can use this awk com-
       mand to extract the file name from the transfer log files:

       awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' &lt; /usr/adm/xferlog

       You may want to save often used panelize commands under  a
       descriptive name, so that you can recall them quickly. You
       do this by typing the command on the input line and press-
       ing  Add new button. Then you enter a name under which you
       want the command to be saved. Next time, you  just  choose
       that  command  from  the  list  and do not have to type it
       again.

    <b>Hotlist</b>
       The Directory hotlist command  shows  the  labels  of  the
       directories in the directory hotlist. The Midnight Comman-
       der will change to  the  directory  corresponding  to  the
       selected  label.  From  the hotlist dialog, you can remove
       already created label/directory pairs and add new one. For
       adding  you  may  want  to use a standalone Add to hotlist
       command (C-x h), which adds the current directory into the
       directory  hotlist,  as  well.  The user is prompted for a
       label for the directory.

       This makes cd to often used directories  faster.  You  may
       consider  using the CDPATH variable as described in inter-
       nal cd command description.

    <b>Extension</b> <b>File</b> <b>Edit</b>
       This will invoke your editor on the  file  ~/.mc/ext.  The
       format  of this file is as follows (the format has changed
       with version 3.0):

       All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown  away.

       Lines  starting  in the first column should have following
       format:

       <i>keyword/descNL,</i> i.e. everything after <i>keyword/</i>  until  new
       line is <i>desc</i>

       keyword can be:

       <i>shell</i>

              (desc  is  then  any extension (no wildcards), i.e.
              matches all the files *desc . Example: .tar matches
              *.tar)

       <i>regex</i>

                         20 October 1997                       19

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

              (desc is a regular expression)

       <i>type</i>

              (file  matches  this  if  `file %f` matches regular
              expression desc (the filename: part from `file  %f`
              is removed))

       <i>default</i>

              (matches any file no matter what desc is)

       Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be
       of the format:

       <i>keyword=commandNL</i> (with no spaces around =), where <i>keyword</i>
       should be:

       <i>Open</i>  (if the user presses Enter or doubleclicks it), <i>View</i>
       (F3), <i>Edit</i> (F4), <i>Drop</i> (user drops some files on it) or any
       other  user  defined  name  (those  will  be listed in the
       extension dependent pop-up menu).  <i>Icon</i> name  is  reserved
       for future use by mc.

       <i>command</i>  is  any  one-line  shell command, with the simple
       macro substitution.

       Target are evaluated from top to  bottom  (order  is  thus
       important).  If some actions are missing, search continues
       as if this target didn't match (i.e. if a file matches the
       first  and  second entry and View action is missing in the
       first one, then on pressing F3 the View  action  from  the
       second  entry  will  be used. default should catch all the
       actions.

    <b>Background</b> <b>jobs</b>
       This lets you control the state of any background Midnight
       Commander process (only copy and move files operations can
       be done in the background).  You  can  stop,  restart  and
       kill a background job from here.

    <b>Menu</b> <b>File</b> <b>Edit</b>
       The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be cus-
       tomized by the user. When you access the  user  menu,  the
       file  .mc.menu  from  the  current directory is used if it
       exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and is not
       world-writable.   If  no  such  file  found, ~/.mc/menu is
       tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses  the  default
       system-wide menu @prefix@/lib/mc/mc.menu.

       The  format  of  the  menu file is very simple. Lines that
       start with  anything  but  space  or  tab  are  considered

                         20 October 1997                       20

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       entries for the menu (in order to be able to use it like a
       hot key, the first character should be a letter). All  the
       lines  that  start  with a space or a tab are the commands
       that will be executed when the entry is selected.

       When an option is selected all the command  lines  of  the
       option  are  copied  to  a temporary file in the temporary
       directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that  file  is  exe-
       cuted. This allows the user to put normal shell constructs
       in the menus. Also simple macro substitution  takes  place
       before  executing the menu code. For more information, see
       macro substitution.

       Here is a sample mc.menu file:

       A    Dump the currently selected file
            od -c %f

       B    Edit a bug report and send it to root
            vi /tmp/mail.$$
            mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root &lt; /tmp/mail.$$

       M    Read mail
            emacs -f rmail

       N    Read Usenet news
            emacs -f gnus

       H    Call the info hypertext browser
            info

       J    Copy current directory to other panel recursively
            tar cf - . | (cd %D && tar xvpf -)

       K    Make a release of the current subdirectory
            echo -n "Name of distribution file: "
            read tar
            ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar
            cd ..
            tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
            tar xzvf %f

       <b>Default</b> <b>Conditions</b>

       Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condi-
       tion  must  start from the first column with a '=' charac-
       ter. If the condition is true, the menu entry will be  the
       default entry.

       Condition syntax:   = &lt;sub-cond&gt;
         or:               = &lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...

                         20 October 1997                       21

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

         or:               = &lt;sub-cond&gt; & &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...

       Sub-condition is one of following:

         f &lt;pattern&gt;       current file matching pattern?
         F &lt;pattern&gt;       other file matching pattern?
         d &lt;pattern&gt;       current directory matching pattern?
         D &lt;pattern&gt;       other directory matching pattern?
         t &lt;type&gt;          current file of type?
         T &lt;type&gt;          other file of type?
         ! &lt;sub-cond&gt;      negate the result of sub-condition

       Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression,
       according to the shell patterns option. You  can  override
       the  global  value of the shell patterns option by writing
       "shell_patterns=x" on the first  line  of  the  menu  file
       (where "x" is either 0 or 1).

       Type is one or more of the following characters:

         n  not directory
         r  regular file
         d  directory
         l  link
         c  char special
         b  block special
         f  fifo
         s  socket
         x  executable
         t  tagged

       For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo.
       The 't' type is a little special because it  acts  on  the
       panel instead of the file. The condition '=t t' is true if
       there are tagged files in the current panel and  false  if
       not.

       If  the  condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug
       trace will be shown whenever the value of the condition is
       calculated.

       The  conditions  are  calculated  from left to right. This
       means
            = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       is calculated as
            ( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)

       Here is a sample of the use of conditions:

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       L    List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
            gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -

       <b>Addition</b> <b>Conditions</b>

                         20 October 1997                       22

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of  '='
       (or '=?') it is an addition condition. If the condition is
       true the menu entry will be included in the menu.  If  the
       condition  is false the menu entry will not be included in
       the menu.

       You can combine default and addition conditions by  start-
       ing  condition with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you
       want debug trace). If you want to use two different condi-
       tions,  one for adding and another for defaulting, you can
       precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one  start-
       ing with '+' and another starting with '='.

       Comments  are  started  with  '#'.  The additional comment
       lines must start with '#', space or tab.

  <b>Options</b> <b>Menu</b>
       The Configuration command pops up a dialog from which  you
       can change most of settings of the Midnight Commander.

       The  Display  bits command pops up a dialog from which you
       may select which characters is your terminal able to  dis-
       play.

       The  Confirmation  command pops up a dialog from which you
       specify which actions you want to confirm.

       The Learn keys command pops up a  dialog  from  which  you
       test some keys which are not working on some terminals and
       you may fix them.

       The Virtual FS command pops up a  dialog  from  which  you
       specify some VFS related options.

       The Layout command pops up a dialog from which you specify
       a bunch of options how mc looks like on the screen.

       The Save setup command saves the current settings  of  the
       Left,  Right  and  Options  menus. A small number of other
       settings is saved, too.

    <b>Configuration</b>
       The program has some options that may be  toggled  on  and
       off  from the Configuration dialog. Options are enabled if
       they have an asterisk or  "x"  in  front  of  them.  These
       options  are  divided  into  three  groups: Screen Colors,
       Panel Options and Other Options.

       <b>Screen</b> <b>Colors</b>

       You can select whether your display supports color or not.
       Normally  this information is in the terminfo database. If

                         20 October 1997                       23

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       you want to know how to change individual colors  see  the
       section on Colors.

       <b>Panel</b> <b>Options</b>

       <i>Show</i>  <i>Backup</i>  <i>Files.</i>   By  default  the Midnight Commander
       doesn't show files ending in '~'  (like  GNU's  ls  option
       -B).

       <i>Show</i> <i>Hidden</i> <i>Files.</i>  By default the Midnight Commander will
       show all files that start with a dot (like ls -a).

       <i>Mark</i> <i>moves</i> <i>down.</i>  By default when you mark  a  file  (with
       either  C-t or the Insert key) the selection bar will move
       down.

       <i>Show</i> <i>Mini-Status.</i>  If enabled, show  one  line  of  status
       information  at  the  bottom  of the panels about the cur-
       rently selected item.

       <i>Mix</i> <i>all</i> <i>files.</i>  When this option is enabled, all files and
       directories  are  shown  mixed  together. If the option is
       off, directories (and links to directories) are  shown  at
       the  beginning of the listing, and other files afterwards.

       <i>Fast</i> <i>directory</i> <i>reload.</i>  This option is off by default.  If
       you  activate the fast reload, the Midnight Commander will
       use a trick to determine if the  directory  contents  have
       changed.  The trick is to reload the directory only if the
       i-node of the  directory  has  changed;  this  means  that
       reloads  only happen when files are created or deleted. If
       what changes is the i-node for a  file  in  the  directory
       (file  size  changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the dis-
       play is not updated. In  these  cases,  if  you  have  the
       option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with
       C-r).

       <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>

       <i>Verbose</i> <i>operation.</i>  This toggles whether  the  file  Copy,
       Rename  and Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display a
       dialog box for each operation). If you have a slow  termi-
       nal,  you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is
       automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal  is
       less than 9600 bps.

       <i>Pause</i>  <i>after</i> <i>run.</i>  After executing your commands, the Mid-
       night Commander can pause, so that  you  can  examine  the
       output  of the command.  There are three possible settings
       for this variable:

              <i>Never</i> Means that you do not want to see the  output
              of your command.  If you are using the Linux or SCO
              console or an xterm, you will be able  to  see  the

                         20 October 1997                       24

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

              output of the command by typing C-o.

              <i>On</i> <i>dumb</i> <i>terminals</i> You will get the pause message on
              terminals that are not capable of showing the  out-
              put of the last command executed (any terminal that
              is not an xterm or the Linux console).

              <i>Always</i> The program will pause after  executing  all
              of your commands.

       <i>Shell</i>  <i>Patterns.</i>  By default the Select, Unselect and Fil-
       ter commands will use shell-like regular expressions.  The
       following  conversions  are performed to achieve this: the
       '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the '?'
       is  replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the
       literal dot. If the option is disabled, then  the  regular
       expressions are the ones described in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ed+1">ed(1)</A>.

       <i>Auto</i> <i>Save</i> <i>Setup.</i>  If this option is enabled, when you exit
       the Midnight Commander the  configurable  options  of  the
       Midnight Commander are saved in the ~/.mc/ini file.

       <i>Auto</i> <i>menus.</i>  If this option is enabled, the user menu will
       be invoked at startup.  Useful for building menus for non-
       unixers.

       <i>Use</i>  <i>internal</i>  <i>editor.</i>   If  this  option  is enabled, the
       built-in file editor is used to edit files. If the  option
       is  disabled,  the editor specified in the <b>EDITOR</b> environ-
       ment variable is used.  If no editor is specified,  <b>vi</b>  is
       used.  See the section on the internal file editor.

       <i>Use</i>  <i>internal</i>  <i>viewer.</i>   If  this  option  is enabled, the
       built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the  option
       is  disabled, the pager specified in the <b>PAGER</b> environment
       variable is used.  If no pager is specified, the <b>view</b> com-
       mand  is  used.   See  the  section  on  the internal file
       viewer.

       <i>Confirm</i> <i>Delete.</i>  This option is toggled on by default, and
       will  cause the Midnight Commander to ask for confirmation
       when deleting a single file.

       <i>Cd</i> <i>follows</i> <i>links.</i>  This option, if set,  causes  the  Mid-
       night Commander to follow the logical chain of directories
       when changing current directory either in the  panels,  or
       using  the  cd  command.  This  is the default behavior of
       bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows the  real
       directory  structure,  so  cd  ..  if  you've entered that
       directory through a link will  move  you  to  the  current
       directory's real parent and not to the directory where the
       link was present.

    <b>Display</b> <b>bits</b>
       This is used to configure the range of visible  characters
       on  the screen.  This setting may be 7-bits if your termi-
       nal/curses supports only  seven  output  bits,  ISO-8859-1
       displays all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map and full
       8 bits is for those terminals that can display full 8  bit
       characters.

    <b>Confirmation</b>
       In  this  menu  you configure the confirmation options for
       file deletion, overwriting, execution  by  pressing  enter
       and quitting the program.

    <b>Learn</b> <b>keys</b>
       This  dialog lets you test if your keys F1-F20, Home, End,
       etc. work properly on your  terminal.  They  often  don't,
       since many terminal databases are broken.

       You  can  move around with the Tab key, with the vi moving
       keys ('h' left, 'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right) and  after
       you  press any arrow key once (this will mark it OK), then
       you can use that key as well.

       You test them just by pressing each of them.  As  soon  as
       you  press  a  key  and  the key works properly, OK should
       appear next to the name of that key. Once a key is  marked
       OK  it  starts  to  work as usually, e.g. F1 for the first
       time will just check that F1 works OK, but from that  time
       on it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.
       Tab key should be working always.

       If some keys do not work properly, then you won't  see  OK
       after  the  key  name after you have pressed that key. You
       may then want to fix it. You do it by pressing the  button
       of  that  key  (either  by  mouse or using Tab and Enter).
       Then a red message will appear and you will  be  asked  to
       type  that key.  If you want to abort this, press just Esc
       and wait until the message disappears. Otherwise type  the
       key  you're  asked  to type and also wait until the dialog
       disappears.

       When you finish with all the keys, you may want either  to
       Save  your  key  fixes  into  your ~/.mc/ini file into the
       [terminal:TERM] section (where TERM is the  name  of  your
       current  terminal)  or  to  discard them. If all your keys
       were working properly and you had not to fix any key, then
       (of course) no saving will occur.

    <b>Virtual</b> <b>FS</b>
       This  option  gives  you  control over the settings of the
       Virtual File System information cache.

                         20 October 1997                       26

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       The Midnight Commander keeps  in  memory  the  information
       related  to  some  of the virtual file systems to speed up
       the access to the files in the  file  system.   Since  the
       information  that  must be kept may be large (for example,
       compressed tar  files  may  be  kept  in  RAM  for  faster
       access), you may want to tune the parameters of the cached
       information to decrease your memory usage or  to  maximize
       the speed of access to frequently used file systems.

       The  Tar  file system is quite clever about how it handles
       tar files: it just loads the directory entries and when it
       needs to use the information contained in the tar file, it
       goes and grab it.

       In the wild, tar files are usually kept compressed  (plain
       tar  files  are species in extinction), and because of the
       nature of those files (the directory entries for  the  tar
       files  is  not there waiting for us to be loaded), the tar
       file system has two choices:  load  the  complete,  uncom-
       pressed tar file into memory or uncompress the file in the
       disk in a temporary location and then  access  the  uncom-
       pressed file as a regular tar file.

       In  this  dialog box you tell the Midnight Commander which
       sizes for compressed tar files you will tolerate  to  load
       into  your precious memory.  The default setting is set to
       one megabyte, this means that compressed tar  files  whose
       size  is  at  most  one megabyte will be loaded into core,
       otherwise a temporary uncompressed tar file will  be  cre-
       ated to access the contents (all of this is transparent to
       the user).

       The program will let you add a suffix to specify the units
       of  the  number you typed in, use 'k' for kilobyte and 'm'
       for megabyte.  Our routine does not accept floating  point
       numbers, so you can't use ".5 m" to specify 512 kilobytes,
       you will have to use "512 k" instead.

       Now, since we all love to browse files and tar  files  all
       over  the disk, it's common that you will leave a tar file
       and the re-enter it later.  Since uncompression  is  slow,
       the  Midnight Commander will cache the information in mem-
       ory for a limited amount of time, after you hit the  time-
       out,  all of the memory resources associated with the file
       system will be freed.  The default timeout is set  to  one
       minute.

    <b>Layout</b>
       The  layout  dialog  gives you a possibility to change the
       general layout of screen.  You  can  specify  whether  the
       menubar,  the command prompt, the hintbar and the function
       keybar are visible. On the Linux or SCO  console  you  can
       specify how many lines are shown in the output window.

                         20 October 1997                       27

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       The  rest of the screen area is used for the two directory
       panels. You can specify whether the area is split  to  the
       panels  in vertical or horizontal direction. The split can
       be equal or you can specify an unequal split.

    <b>Save</b> <b>Setup</b>
       At startup the Midnight Commander will try  to  load  ini-
       tialization  information  from the ~/.mc/ini file. If this
       file doesn't exist, it will load the information from  the
       system-wide   configuration   file,   located   in   @pre-
       fix@/lib/mc/mc.ini. If the system-wide configuration  file
       doesn't exist, MC uses the default settings.

       The  <i>Save</i> <i>Setup</i> command creates the ~/.mc/ini file by sav-
       ing the current settings of the Left,  Right  and  Options
       menus.

       If you activate the <i>auto</i> <i>save</i> <i>setup</i> option, MC will always
       save the current settings when exiting.

       There also exist settings which can't be changed from  the
       menus. To change these settings you have to edit the setup
       file with your favorite editor. See the section on Special
       Settings for more information.

Executing operating system commands
       You  may  execute  commands by typing them directly in the
       Midnight Commander's input line, or by selecting the  pro-
       gram  you want to execute with the selection bar in one of
       the panels and hitting Enter.

       If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, the
       Midnight  Commander  checks  the extension of the selected
       file against the extensions in the Extensions File.  If  a
       match  is  found then the code associated with that exten-
       sion is executed. A  very  simple  macro  expansion  takes
       place before executing the command.

  <b>The</b> <b>cd</b> <b>internal</b> <b>command</b>
       The  <i>cd</i>  command is interpreted by the Midnight Commander,
       it is not passed to the command shell for execution.  Thus
       it may not handle all of the nice macro expansion and sub-
       stitution that your shell does, although it does  some  of
       them:

       <i>Tilde</i>  <i>substitution</i>  The (~) will be substituted with your
       home directory, if you append a username after the  tilde,
       then  it  will  be substituted with the login directory of
       the the specified user.

                         20 October 1997                       28

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       For example, ~guest is the home  directory  for  the  user
       guest,  while  ~/guest is the directory guest in your home
       directory.

       <i>Previous</i> <i>directory</i> You can jump to the directory you  were
       previously  by  using  the special directory name '-' like
       this: <b>cd</b> <b>-</b>

       <i>CDPATH</i> <i>directories</i> If the directory specified  to  the  <b>cd</b>
       command is not in the current directory, then The Midnight
       Commander uses  the  value  in  the  environment  variable
       <b>CDPATH</b>  to  search  for  the directory in any of the named
       directories.

       For  example  you  could  set  your  <b>CDPATH</b>  variable   to
       ~/src:/usr/src,  allowing  you to change your directory to
       any of the  directories  inside  the  ~/src  and  /usr/src
       directories,  from  any  place in the file system by using
       it's relative name (for example cd linux could take you to
       /usr/src/linux).

  <b>Macro</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       When  accessing  a  user  menu,  or executing an extension
       dependent command, or running a command from  the  command
       line input, a simple macro substitution takes place.

       The macros are:

       <i>%f</i>

              The current file name.

       <i>%d</i>

              The current directory name.

       <i>%F</i>

              The current file in the unselected panel.

       <i>%D</i>

              The directory name of the unselected panel.

       <i>%t</i>

              The currently tagged files.

       <i>%T</i>

              The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       <i>%u</i> and <i>%U</i>

                         20 October 1997                       29

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

              Similar  to  the  %t and %T macros, but in addition
              the files are untagged. You can use this macro only
              once  per  menu file entry or extension file entry,
              because next time there will be no tagged files.

       <i>%s</i> and <i>%S</i>

              The selected files: The tagged files if  there  are
              any. Otherwise the current file.

       <i>%q</i>

              Dropped  files.  In  all  places except in the Drop
              action of the mc.ext file, this will become a  null
              string, in the Drop action it will be replaced with
              a space separated list of files that  were  dropped
              on the file.

       <i>%cd</i>

              This  is a special macro that is used to change the
              current directory to  the  directory  specified  in
              front  of  it.  This is used primarily as an inter-
              face to the Virtual File System.

       <i>%view</i>

              This macro is used to invoke the  internal  viewer.
              This  macro  can  be used alone, or with arguments.
              If you pass  any  arguments  to  this  macro,  they
              should be enclosed in brackets.

              The  arguments  are: <i>ascii</i> to force the viewer into
              ascii mode; <i>hex</i> to force the viewer into hex  mode;
              <i>nroff</i>  to  tell the viewer that it should interpret
              the bold and underline sequences of  nroff;  <i>unfor-</i>
              <i>mated</i>  to  tell  the  viewer to not interpret nroff
              commands for making the text bold or underlined.

       <i>%%</i>

              The % character

       <i>%{some</i> <i>text}</i>

              Prompt for the substitution. An input box is  shown
              and the text inside the braces is used as a prompt.
              The macro is substituted by the text typed  by  the
              user. The user can press ESC or F10 to cancel. This
              macro doesn't work on the command line yet.

  <b>The</b> <b>subshell</b> <b>support</b>
       The subshell support is a compile time option, that  works

                         20 October 1997                       30

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       with the shells: bash, tcsh and zsh.

       When the subshell code is activated the Midnight Commander
       will spawn a  concurrent  copy  of  your  shell  (the  one
       defined  in  the  <b>SHELL</b> variable and if it is not defined,
       then the one in the /etc/passwd file)  and  run  it  in  a
       pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time
       you execute a command, the command will be passed  to  the
       subshell  as if you had typed it.  This also allows you to
       change the environment variables, use shell functions  and
       define  aliases that are valid until you quit the Midnight
       Commander.

       If you are using <b>bash</b> you can specify startup commands for
       the  subshell  in  your ~/.mc/bashrc file and special key-
       board maps in the  ~/.mc/inputrc  file.   <b>tcsh</b>  users  may
       specify startup commands in the ~/.mc/tcshrc file.

       When  the  subshell code is used, you can suspend applica-
       tions at any time with the sequence C-o and jump  back  to
       the  Midnight  Commander, if you interrupt an application,
       you will not be able to run other external commands  until
       you quit the application you interrupted.

       An  extra  added feature of using the subshell is that the
       prompt displayed by the Midnight  Commander  is  the  same
       prompt that you are currently using in your shell.

       The  OPTIONS  section  has more information on how you can
       control the subshell code.

  <b>Controlling</b> <b>Midnight</b> <b>Commander</b>
       The Midnight Commander  defines  an  environment  variable
       MC_CONTROL_FILE.  The  commands  executed  by  MC may give
       instructions to MC by writing to  the  file  specified  by
       this  variable.   This  is  only available if you compiled
       your copy of the Midnight Commander  with  the  WANT_PARSE
       option.

       The following instructions are supported.

       clear_tags          Clear all tags.
       tag &lt;filename&gt;      Tag specified file.
       untag &lt;filename&gt;    Untag specified file.
       select &lt;filename&gt;   Move pointer to file.
       change_panel        Switch between panels.
       cd &lt;path&gt;      Change directory.

       If the first letter of the instruction is in lower case it
       operates on the current panel. If the letter is  in  upper
       case  the  instruction  operates  on  the other panel. The
       additional letters must be  in  lower  case.  Instructions
       must  be  separated  by exactly one space, tab or newline.

                         20 October 1997                       31

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       The instructions don't work in the Info,  Tree  and  Quick
       views. The first error causes the rest to be ignored.

Chmod
       The Chmod window is used to change the attribute bits in a
       group of files and directories.  It can  be  invoked  with
       the C-x c key combination.

       The Chmod window has two parts - <i>Permissions</i> and <i>File</i>

       In  the File section are displayed the name of the file or
       directory and its permissions in octal form,  as  well  as
       its owner and group.

       In the Permissions section there is a set of check buttons
       which correspond to  the  file  attribute  bits.   As  you
       change  the  attribute  bits,  you can see the octal value
       change in the File section.

       To move between the widgets (buttons  and  check  buttons)
       use the <i>arrow</i> <i>keys</i> or the <i>Tab</i> key.  To change the state of
       the check buttons or to select a button  use  <i>Space.</i>   You
       can  also  use the hotkeys on the buttons to quickly acti-
       vate that selection (they are the highlit letters  on  the
       buttons).

       To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.

       When  working  with  a  group of files or directories, you
       just click on the bits you want to set or clear.  Once you
       have  selected the bits you want to change, you select one
       of the action buttons (Set marked or Clear marked).

       Finally, to set the attributes exactly to those specified,
       you  can  use  the <b>[Set</b> <b>all]</b> button, which will act on all
       the tagged files.

       <b>[Marked</b> <b>all]</b> set only marked attributes  to  all  selected
       files

       <b>[Set</b> <b>marked]</b> set marked bits in attributes of all selected
       files

       <b>[Clean</b> <b>marked]</b> clear marked  bits  in  attributes  of  all
       selected files

       <b>[Set]</b> set the attributes of one file

       <b>[Cancel]</b> cancel the Chmod command

Chown
       The  Chown  command is used to change the owner/group of a

                         20 October 1997                       32

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       file. The hot key for this command is C-x o.

File Operations
       When you copy, move or delete files the Midnight Commander
       shows  the file operations dialog. It shows the files cur-
       rently being operated on  and  there  are  at  most  three
       progress bars. The file bar tells how big part of the cur-
       rent file has been copied so far. The count bar tells  how
       many  of  tagged files have been handled so far. The bytes
       bar tells how big part of total size of the  tagged  files
       has  been handled so far. If the verbose option is off the
       file and bytes bars are not shown.

       There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog.  Press-
       ing  the  Skip  button  will  skip the rest of the current
       file. Pressing the Abort button will abort the whole oper-
       ation, the rest of the files are skipped.

       There  are three other dialogs which you can run into dur-
       ing the file operations.

       The error dialog informs about error  conditions  and  has
       three  choices. Normally you select either the Skip button
       to skip the file or the Abort button to abort  the  opera-
       tion  altogether.  You can also select the Retry button if
       you fixed the problem from another terminal.

       The replace dialog is shown when you attempt  to  copy  or
       move  a  file  on  the top of an existing file. The dialog
       shows the dates and sizes of the both files. Press the Yes
       button  to  overwrite  the file, the No button to skip the
       file, the alL button to overwrite all the files, the  nonE
       button  to  never overwrite and the Update button to over-
       write if the source file is newer than  the  target  file.
       You  can  abort  the whole operation by pressing the Abort
       button.

       The recursive delete dialog  is  shown  when  you  try  to
       delete  a directory which is not empty. Press the Yes but-
       ton to delete the directory recursively, the No button  to
       skip  the  directory,  the  alL  button  to delete all the
       directories and the nonE button to skip all the  non-empty
       directories. You can abort the whole operation by pressing
       the Abort button. If you selected the Yes  or  alL  button
       you  will  be asked for a confirmation. Type "yes" only if
       you are really sure you want to do the recursive delete.

       If you have tagged files and perform an operation on  them
       only  the  files  on  which  the  operation  succeeded are
       untagged. Failed and skipped files are left tagged.

Mask Copy/Rename
       The copy/move operations lets you translate the  names  of
       files  in  an  easy way. To do it, you have to specify the
       correct source mask and usually in the  trailing  part  of
       the  destination  specify  some  wildcards.  All the files
       matching the source mask are copied/renamed  according  to
       the  target  mask.  If  there  are  tagged files, only the
       tagged files matching the source mask are renamed.

       There are other option which you can set:

       Follow links tells whether make the symlinks and hardlinks
       in  the  source  directory (recursively in subdirectories)
       new links in the target directory  or  whether  would  you
       like to copy their content.

       Dive into subdirs tells what to do if in the target direc-
       tory  exists  a  directory  with  the  same  name  as  the
       file/directory being copied. The default action is to copy
       it's content into that directory, by enabling this you can
       copy the source directory into that directory.  Perhaps an
       example will help:

       You want to copy content of a directory foo  to  /bla/foo,
       which  is  an  already  existing directory. Normally (when
       Dive is not set), mc would copy it exactly into  /bla/foo.
       By  enabling  this  option  you will copy the content into
       /bla/foo/foo, because the directory already exists.

       Preserve attributes tells whether to preserve the original
       files' permissions, timestamps and if you are root whether
       to preserve the original  files'  UID  and  GID.  If  this
       option  is  not set the current value of the umask will be
       respected.

       <b>Use</b> <b>shell</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b>

       When the shell patterns option is on you can use  the  '*'
       and '?'  wildcards in the source mask. They work like they
       do in the shell. In the  target  mask  only  the  '*'  and
       '\&lt;digit&gt;'  wildcards  are allowed. The first '*' wildcard
       in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group
       in the source mask, the second '*' corresponds to the sec-
       ond group and so on. The '\1' wildcard corresponds to  the
       first wildcard group in the source mask, the '\2' wildcard
       corresponds to the second group and so on all the  way  up
       to  '\9'.  The  '\0' wildcard is the whole filename of the
       source file.

       Two examples:

       If the source  mask  is  "*.tar.gz",  the  destination  is
       "/bla/*.tgz"  and  the  file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz",
       the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".

                         20 October 1997                       34

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       Let's suppose you want to swap basename and  extension  so
       that  "file.c"  will become "c.file" and so on. The source
       mask for this is "*.*" and the destination is "\2.\1".

       <b>Use</b> <b>shell</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>off</b>

       When the shell patterns option is off the  MC  doesn't  do
       automatic grouping anymore. You must use '\(...\)' expres-
       sions in the source mask to specify meaning for the  wild-
       cards  in  the target mask. This is more flexible but also
       requires more typing. Otherwise target masks  are  similar
       to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.

       Two examples:

       If the source mask is "^\(.*\)\.tar\.gz$", the destination
       is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz",
       the copy will be "/bla/foo.tgz".

       Let's  suppose  you want to swap basename and extension so
       that "file.c" will become "c.file" and so on.  The  source
       mask for this is "^\(.*\)\.\(.*\)$" and the destination is
       "\2.\1".

       <b>Case</b> <b>Conversions</b>

       You can also change the case of the filenames. If you  use
       '\u' or uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.

       If  you use '\U' or '\L' in the target mask the next char-
       acters will be converted to uppercase or lowercase  corre-
       spondingly up to the next

       The '\u' and '\l' are stronger than '\U' and '\L'.

       For example, if the source mask is '*' (shell patterns on)
       or '^\(.*\)$' (shell patterns off) and the target mask  is
       '\L\u*'  the  file names will be converted to have initial
       upper case and otherwise lower case.

       You can also use '\' as a quote  character.  For  example,
       '\\' is a backslash and '\*' is an asterisk.

Internal File Viewer
       The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII
       and hex.  To toggle between modes, use the F4 key.  If you
       have  the  GNU  gzip program installed, it will be used to
       automatically decompress the files on demand.

       The viewer will try to use the  best  method  provided  by
       your  system  or the file type to display the information.
       The  internal  file  viewer  will  interpret  some  string
       sequences  to  set the bold and underline attributes, thus

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       making a pretty display of your files.

       When in hex mode, the  search  function  accepts  text  in
       quotes as well as hexadecimal constants.

       You can mix quoted text with constants like this: "String"
       0xFE 0xBB "more text".  Text between constants and  quoted
       text is just ignored.

       Some  internal  details  about the viewer: On systems that
       provide the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mmap+2">mmap(2)</A> system call, the program maps the file
       instead  of loading it; if the system does not provide the
       <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mmap+2">mmap(2)</A> system call or the file  matches  an  action  that
       requires  a  filter, then the viewer will use it's growing
       buffers, thus loading only those parts of  the  file  that
       you actually access (this includes compressed files).

       Here  is a listing of the actions associated with each key
       that the Midnight Commander handles in the  internal  file
       viewer.

       <b>F1</b> Invoke the builtin hypertext help viewer.

       <b>F2</b> Toggle the wrap mode.

       <b>F4</b> Toggle the hex mode.

       <b>F5</b>  Goto line.  This will prompt you for a line number and
       will display that line.

       <b>F6,</b> <b>/.</b>  Regular expression search.

       <b>?,</b> Reverse regular expression search.

       <b>F7</b> Normal search / hex mode search.

       <b>C-s.</b>  Start normal search if there was no previous  search
       expression else find next match.

       <b>C-r.</b>  Start reverse search if there was no previous search
       expression else find next match.

       <b>n.</b>  Find next match.

       <b>F8</b> Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This  will  show  the  file  as
       found on disk or if a processing filter has been specified
       in the mc.ext file, then the output from the filter.  Cur-
       rent  mode  is always the other than written on the button
       label, since on the button is the mode which you enter  by
       that key.

       <b>F9</b> Toggle the format/unformat mode: when format mode is on
       the viewer will interpret some string  sequences  to  show
       bold  and underline with different colors. Also, on button

       label is the other mode than current.

       <b>F10,</b> <b>Esc.</b>  Exit the internal file viewer.

       <b>next-page,</b> <b>space,</b> <b>C-v.</b>  Scroll one page forward.

       <b>prev-page,</b> <b>M-v,</b> <b>C-b,</b> <b>backspace.</b>  Scroll one page backward.

       <b>down-key</b> Scroll one line forward.

       <b>up-key</b> Scroll one line backward.

       <b>C-l</b> Refresh the screen.

       <b>!</b>  Spawn a shell in the currently working directory.

       <b>[n]</b> <b>m</b> Set the mark n.

       <b>[n]</b> <b>r</b> Jump to the mark n.

       <b>C-f</b> Jump to the next file.

       <b>C-b</b> Jump to the previous file.

       <b>M-r</b> Toggle the ruler.

       It's possible to instruct the file viewer how to display a
       file, look at the Extension File Edit section

Internal File Editor
       The internal file editor provides most of the features  of
       common  full  screen  editors. It is invoked using <b>F4</b> pro-
       vided the <i>use</i><b>_</b><i>internal</i><b>_</b><i>edit</i> option is set in the  initial-
       ization file. It has an extensible file size limit of six-
       teen megabytes and edits binary files flawlessly.

       The features it presently supports are: Block copy,  move,
       delete,  cut,  paste;  <i>key</i> <i>for</i> <i>key</i> <i>undo</i> <i>;</i> pull-down menus;
       file  insertion;  macro  definition;  regular   expression
       search  and  replace  (and our own scanf-printf search and
       replace); shift-arrow MSW-MAC text highlighting  (for  the
       linux  console  only);  insert-overwrite  toggle;  and  an
       option to pipe text blocks  through  shell  commands  like
       indent.

       The  editor  is very easy to use and requires no tutoring.
       To see what keys do what,  just  consult  the  appropriate
       pull-down  menu.  Other  keys  are: Shift movement keys do
       text  highlighting.    <b>Ctrl-Ins</b>   copies   to   the   file
       <b>cooledit.clip</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>Shift-Ins</b>  pastes  from cooledit.clip.
       <b>Shift-Del</b> cuts  to  <b>cooledit.clip,</b>  and  <b>Ctrl-Del</b>  deletes
       highlighted  text.  The  completion key also does a Return
       with an automatic indent. Mouse highlighting  also  works,
       and  you  can  override the mouse as usual by holding down

                         20 October 1997                       37

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal  ter-
       minal mouse highlighting work.

       To define a macro, press <b>Ctrl-R</b>
        and  then  type  out  the key strokes you want to be exe-
       cuted. Press <b>Ctrl-R</b>
        again when finished. You can then assign the macro to any
       key  you  like by pressing that key. The macro is executed
       when you press <b>Ctrl-A</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>key.</b> <b>The</b> <b>macro</b>
       <b>is</b>  <b>also</b>  <b>executed</b> <b>if</b> you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the
       assigned key, provided that the key is not  used  for  any
       other  function.  Once defined, the macro commands go into
       the file <b>cedit/cooledit.macros</b>
        in your home directory. You can delete a macro by  delet-
       ing the appropriate line in this file.

       <b>F19</b> <b>will</b> <b>format</b> <b>C</b> <b>code</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>highlighted.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> to
       work, make an executable file called  <b>cedit/edit.indent.rc</b>
       in your home directory containing the following:

       #!/bin/sh
       /usr/bin/indent -kr -pcs ~/cedit/cooledit.block &gt;& /dev/null
       cat /dev/null &gt; ~/cedit/cooledit.error

       You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace
       a C format string. First take a look  at  the  <b>sscanf</b>  and
       <b>sprintf</b>  <b>man</b>  <b>pages</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>format</b> <b>string</b> is and how
       it works. An example is as follows: Suppose  you  want  to
       replace  all  occurences  of  say,  an open bracket, three
       comma seperated numbers, and a  close  bracket,  with  the
       word  <i>apples,</i>  the third number, the word <i>oranges</i> and then
       the second number, I would fill in the Replace dialog  box
       as follows:

        Enter search string
       (%d,%d,%d)
        Enter replace string
       apples %d oranges %d
        Enter replacement argument order
       3,2

       The last line specifies that the third and then the second
       number are to be used in place of the first and second.

       It is advisable to use this feature with Prompt on replace
       on,  because  a  match is thought to be found whenever the
       number of arguments found matches the number given,  which
       is  not  always a real match. Scanf also treats whitespace
       as being elastic.  Note that the scanf format  %  is  very
       useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.

       The  editor  also  displays non-us characters (160+). When
       editing binary files, you should set  <b>display</b>  <b>bits</b>  to  7
       bits in the options menu to keep the spacing clean.

                         20 October 1997                       38

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       See  also the file <b>README.edit</b> in the source tree for some
       more info.

Completion
       Let the Midnight Commander type for you.

       Attempt to perform completion on the text  before  current
       position.  MC  attempts  completion  treating  the text as
       variable (if the text begins with <b>$</b> ),  username  (if  the
       text  begins with <b>~</b> ), hostname (if the text begins with <b>@</b>
       ) or command (if you are on the command line in the  posi-
       tion  where you might type a command, possible completions
       then include shell reserved words and shell  builtin  com-
       mands as well) in turn. If none of these produces a match,
       filename completion is attempted.

       Filename, username, variable and hostname completion works
       on  all  input  lines,  command completion is command line
       specific.  If the completion is ambiguous (there are  more
       different  possibilities),  MC  beeps  and  the  following
       action depends on the setting of the show_all_if_ambiguous
       variable  in  the Initialization file. If it is nonzero, a
       list of all possibilities pops  up  next  to  the  current
       position  and you can select with the arrow keys and <b>Enter</b>
       the correct entry. You can also type the first letters  in
       which  the possibilities differ to move to a subset of all
       possibilities and complete as much  as  possible.  If  you
       press  <b>M-Tab</b>  again,  only the subset will be shown in the
       listbox, otherwise the first item which  matches  all  the
       previous  characters will be highlighted. As soon as there
       is no ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by
       canceling  keys <b>Esc,</b> <b>F10</b> and left and right arrow keys. If
       show_all_if_ambiguous is set to zero, the dialog  pops  up
       only if you press <b>M-Tab</b> for the second time, for the first
       time MC just beeps.

Virtual File System
       The Midnight Commander is provided with a  code  layer  to
       access  the  file  system; this code layer is known as the
       virtual file  system  switch.   The  virtual  file  system
       switch  allows  the Midnight Commander to manipulate files
       not located on the Unix file system.

       Currently the Midnight Commander  is  packaged  with  some
       Virtual  File  Systems  (VFS): the local file system, used
       for accessing the regular Unix  file  system;  the  ftpfs,
       used  to  manipulate  files on remote systems with the FTP
       protocol; the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and compressed
       tar  files;  the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on
       ext2 file systems (the default file system for Linux  sys-
       tems), fish (for manipulating files over shell connections
       such as rsh  and  ssh)  and  finally  the  mcfs  (Midnight

                         20 October 1997                       39

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       Commander file system), a network based file system.

       The  VFS  switch code will interpret all of the path names
       used and will forward them to the correct file system, the
       formats used for each one of the file systems is described
       later in their own section.

  <b>FTP</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b>
       The  ftpfs  allows  you  to  manipulate  files  on  remote
       machines, to actually use it, you may try to use the panel
       command FTP link (accessible from the menubar) or you  may
       directly  change your current directory to it using the cd
       command to a path name that looks like this:

       <i>/#ftp:[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</i>

       The, <i>user,</i> <i>port</i> and <i>remote-dir</i> elements are optional.   If
       you  specify the <i>user</i> element, then the Midnight Commander
       will try to logon on the remote machine as that user, oth-
       erwise  it  will  use  your login name.  The optional <i>pass</i>
       element, if present is the password used for  the  connec-
       tion.   This  use  is  not recomented (nor keeping this in
       your hotlist, unless you set  the  appropiate  permissions
       there, and then, it may not be entirely safe anyways).

       Examples:

           /#ftp:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
           /#ftp:tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
           /#ftp:!behind.firewall.edu/pub
           /#ftp:guest@remote-host.com:40/pub
           /#ftp:miguel:xxx@server/pub

       To  connect  to  sites behind a firewall, you will need to
       use the prefix ftp://! (ie, with a  bang  character  after
       the  double  slash)  to  make the Midnight Commander use a
       proxy host for doing the ftp transfer.  You can define the
       proxy host in the Virtual File System dialog box.

       Another option is to set the <i>ftpfs</i><b>_</b><i>always</i><b>_</b><i>use</i><b>_</b><i>proxy</i> param-
       eter in the initialization file.  This will configure  the
       program to always use the proxy host.  If this variable is
       set, the program will do two  things:  consult  the  @pre-
       fix@/lib/mc.no_proxy  file for lines containing host names
       that are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it  is
       assumed  to  be a domain) and to assume that any hostnames
       without dots in their names are directly accessible.

       If you are using the ftpfs code with  a  filtering  packet
       router  that does not allow you to use the regular mode of
       opening files, you may want to force the  program  to  use
       the   passive-open   mode.    To   use   this,   set   the
       ftpfs_use_passive_connections option.

                         20 October 1997                       40

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       The Midnight Commander keeps the directory  listing  in  a
       cache.   The cache expire time is configurable in the Vir-
       tual File System dialog box.  This has the funny  behavior
       that  even  if  you make changes to a directory, they will
       not be reflected in the directory listing until you  force
       a  cache reload with the C-r key.  This is a feature (when
       you think it's a bug, think about  manipulating  files  on
       the other side of the Atlantic with ftpfs).

  <b>Tar</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b>
       The  tar file system provides you with read-only access to
       your tar files and compressed tar files by using the chdir
       command.   To  change  your  directory  to a tar file, you
       change your current directory to the tar file by using the
       following syntax:

       <i>/filename.tar:utar/[dir-inside-tar]</i>

       The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for tar files,
       this means that usually you just point to a tar  file  and
       press return to enter into the tar file, see the Extension
       File Edit section for details on how this is done.

       Examples:

           mc-3.0.tar.gz#utar/mc-3.0/vfs
           /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar#utar

       The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.

  <b>FIle</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>over</b> <b>SHell</b> <b>filesystem</b>
       The fish file system is a network based file  system  that
       allows  you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as
       if they were local. To use this, the  other  side  has  to
       either  run  fish  server,  or has to have bash-compatible
       shell.

       To connect to a remote machine, you  just  need  to  chdir
       into  a  special  directory which name is in the following
       format:

       /#sh:[user@]machine[:options];/[remote-dir];&lt;/em&gt;
       The, <i>user,</i> <i>options</i> and <i>remote-dir</i>
        elements are optional. If you specify  the  <i>user</i>  element
       then  the  Midnight  Commander  will  try  to logon on the
       remote machine as that user, otherwise it  will  use  your
       login name.

       The  <i>options</i>  are  'C' - use compression and 'rsh' use rsh
       instead of ssh. If the <i>remote-dir</i> element is present, your
       current  directory  on  the  remote machine will be set to
       this one.

  <b>Network</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b>
       The Midnight Commander file system is a network base  file
       system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote
       machine as if they were local.  To use  this,  the  remote
       machine must be running the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mcserv+8">mcserv(8)</A> server program.

       To  connect  to  a  remote machine, you just need to chdir
       into a special directory which name is  in  the  following
       format:

       <i>/#mc:[user@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</i>

       The,  <i>user,</i> <i>port</i> and <i>remote-dir</i> elements are optional.  If
       you specify the <i>user</i> element then the  Midnight  Commander
       will try to logon on the remote machine as that user, oth-
       erwise it will use your login name.

       The <i>port</i> element is used when the remote  machine  running
       on  a special port (see the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mcserv+8">mcserv(8)</A> manual page for more
       information about ports); finally, if the <i>remote-dir</i>  ele-
       ment  is  present,  your  current  directory on the remote
       machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           /#mc:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
           /#mc:joe@foo.edu:11321/private

  <b>Undelete</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b>
       On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs
       undelete  facilities, you will have the undelete file sys-
       tem available.  Recovery of deleted files is  only  avail-
       able  on  ext2  file systems.  The undelete file system is
       just an interface to the ext2fs library to:  retrieve  all
       of  the  deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and
       to extract the selected files into a regular partition.

       To use this file system, you have to chdir into  the  spe-
       cial file name formed by the "/#undel" prefix and the file
       name where the actual file system resides.

       For example, to recover deleted files on the second parti-
       tion  of  the  first scsi disk on Linux, you would use the
       following path name:

           /#undel:/dev/sda2

                         20 October 1997                       42

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       It may take a while for the undelfs to load  the  required
       information before you start browsing files there.

Colors
       The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal
       supports color using the terminal database and your termi-
       nal  name.   Sometimes  it gets confused, so you may force
       color mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b  flag
       respectively.

       If  the  program is compiled with the Slang screen manager
       instead of ncurses, it will also check the  variable  <b>COL-</b>
       <b>ORTERM,</b>  if  it  is  set, it has the same effect as the -c
       flag.

       You may specify terminals that always force color mode  by
       adding  the <i>color</i><b>_</b><i>terminals</i> variable to the Colors section
       of the initialization file. This will prevent the Midnight
       Commander  from trying to detect if your terminal supports
       color. Example:
       [Colors]
       color_terminals=linux,xterm
       color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...

       The program can be compiled with both ncurses  and  slang,
       ncurses  does  not  provide  a  way  to  force color mode:
       ncurses  uses  just  the  information  in   the   terminal
       database.

       The  Midnight  Commander  provides  a  way  to  change the
       default colors.  Currently the colors are configured using
       the environment variable <b>MC_COLOR_TABLE</b> or the Colors sec-
       tion in the initialization file.

       In the Colors section, the default  color  map  is  loaded
       from  the  <i>base</i><b>_</b><i>color</i> variable.  You can specify an alter-
       nate color map for a terminal by using the  terminal  name
       as the key in this section.  Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=
       xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red

       The format for the color definition is:

         &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;foregroundcolor&gt;,&lt;backgroundcolor&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;= ...

       The  colors  are  optional,  and the keywords are: normal,
       selected, marked, markselect, errors, input, reverse menu,
       menusel,  menuhot,  menuhotsel,  gauge;  the dialog colors
       are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus;  Help  colors
       are:  helpnormal,  helpitalic,  helpbold,  helplink, help-
       slink;   Viewer   color   is:    viewunderline;    Special

                         20 October 1997                       43

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       highlighting  mode:  executable,  directory, link, device,
       special.

       The dialog boxes use the following colors: <i>dnormal</i> is used
       for the normal text, <i>dfocus</i> is the color used for the cur-
       rently selected component, <i>dhotnormal</i> is the color used to
       differentiate  the  hotkey  color  in  normal  components,
       whereas the <i>dhotfocus</i> color is used  for  the  highlighted
       color in the currently selected component.

       Menus  use  the  same  scheme  but uses the menu, menusel,
       menuhot and menuhotsel tags instead.

       Help uses the following colors:  <i>helpnormal</i>  is  used  for
       normal  text,  <i>helpitalic</i> is used for text which is empha-
       sized in italic in the manual page, <i>helpbold</i> is  used  for
       text  which  is  emphasized  in  bold  in the manual page,
       <i>helplink</i> is used for not selected hyperlinks and <i>helpslink</i>
       is used for selected hyperlink.

       <i>gauge</i>  determines color of filled part of the progress bar
       (gauge), which shows how many percent of files were copied
       etc. in a graphical way.

       For  file  type  highlighting mode <i>directory</i> specifies the
       color in which directories are shown; <i>executable</i> for  exe-
       cutable files; <i>link</i> is used to represent links; <i>device</i> for
       character and block devices; <i>special</i> is for special files,
       such  as FIFO and IPC sockets; <i>core</i> is for core files (see
       also the option <b>highlight_mode</b> at the section  on  Special
       Settings).

       The  possible  colors  are:  black,  gray, red, brightred,
       green,  brightgreen,  brown,  yellow,  blue,   brightblue,
       magenta,  brightmagenta,  cyan,  brightcyan, lightgray and
       white.

Special Settings
       Most of the settings of  the  Midnight  Commander  can  be
       changed  from the menus. However, there are a small number
       of settings which can only be changed by editing the setup
       file.

       These variables may be set in your ~/.mc/ini file:

       <i>clear</i><b>_</b><i>before</i><b>_</b><i>exec.</i>

              By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen
              before executing a command. If you would prefer  to
              see  the output of the command at the bottom of the
              screen, edit your  ~/mc.ini  file  and  change  the
              value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.

                         20 October 1997                       44

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       <i>confirm</i><b>_</b><i>view</i><b>_</b><i>dir.</i>

              If  you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters
              that directory. If this flag is set to 1,  then  MC
              will  ask  for  confirmation  before  changing  the
              directory if you have files tagged.

       <i>drop</i><b>_</b><i>menus.</i>

              If this variable is set, when you press the F9 key,
              the  pull  down  menus will be activated, else, you
              will only be presented with the menu title, and you
              will  have  to select the entry with the arrow keys
              or the first letter  and  from  there  select  your
              option in the menu.

       <i>ftpfs</i><b>_</b><i>retry</i><b>_</b><i>seconds.</i>

              This  value  is  the number of seconds the Midnight
              Commander will wait before attempting  a  reconnec-
              tion  to  an  ftp server that has denied the login.
              If the value is zero,  the  the  program  will  not
              retry the login.

       <i>ftpfs</i><b>_</b><i>use</i><b>_</b><i>passive</i><b>_</b><i>connections.</i>

              This  option  is  by  off  default.  This makes the
              ftpfs code use the passive open mode for  transfer-
              ing  files.  This is used by people that are behind
              a filtering packet router.  This option just  works
              if you are not using an ftp proxy.

       <i>max</i><b>_</b><i>dirt</i><b>_</b><i>limit.</i>

              Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at
              most in the internal file  viewer.   Normally  this
              value is not significant, because the code automat-
              ically  adjusts  the  number  of  updates  to  skip
              according  to the rate of incoming keypresses. How-
              ever, on very slow machines  or  terminals  with  a
              fast  keyboard  auto  repeat,  a big value can make
              screen updates too jumpy.

              It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to  10  causes
              the best behavior, and that is the default value.

       <i>mouse</i><b>_</b><i>move</i><b>_</b><i>pages.</i>

              Controls  whenever scrolling with the mouse is done
              by pages or line by line on the panels.

       <i>mouse</i><b>_</b><i>move</i><b>_</b><i>pages</i><b>_</b><i>viewer.</i>

              Controls if scrolling with the  mouse  is  done  by

                         20 October 1997                       45

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

              pages  or line by line on the internal file viewer.

       <i>navigate</i><b>_</b><i>with</i><b>_</b><i>arrows.</i>

              If this setting is turned on, then you may use  the
              arrows  keys  to automatically chdir if the current
              selection is a subdirectory and the  shell  command
              line is empty.  By default, this setting is off.

       <i>nice</i><b>_</b><i>rotating</i><b>_</b><i>dash</i>

              When  on,  this flag causes the commander to show a
              rotating dash as a work in progress indicator.

       <i>old</i><b>_</b><i>esc</i><b>_</b><i>mode</i>

              By default the Midnight Commander  treats  the  ESC
              key  as  a  key prefix (old_esc_mode=0), if you set
              this option (old_esc_mode=1), then the ESC key will
              act as a prefix key for one second, and if no extra
              keys have arrived, then the ESC key is  interpreted
              as a cancel key (ESC ESC).

       <i>only</i><b>_</b><i>leading</i><b>_</b><i>plus</i><b>_</b><i>minus</i>

              set  special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in command
              line (select, unselect, reverse selection) only  if
              command  line is empty. No need to quote this char-
              acters in the middle of the command  line.  But  we
              can  not  change selection when command line is not
              empty.  <i>panel</i><b>_</b><i>scroll</i><b>_</b><i>pages</i>

              If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the
              display  when  the  cursor  reaches  the end or the
              beginning of the  panel,  otherwise  it  will  just
              scroll a file at a time.

       <i>preserve</i><b>_</b><i>uidgid</i>

              If this option is set (the default), when logged in
              as root the default will be to preserve the UID and
              the  GID  of  files.   Some users prefer to disable
              this option, so that's why it's configurable.

       <i>show</i><b>_</b><i>output</i><b>_</b><i>starts</i><b>_</b><i>shell</i>

              This variable only works if you are not  using  the
              subshell  support.   When you use the C-o keystroke
              to go back to the user screen, if this one is  set,
              you  will  get  a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing
              any key will bring you back to the Midnight Comman-
              der.

                         20 October 1997                       46

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       <i>show</i><b>_</b><i>all</i><b>_</b><i>if</i><b>_</b><i>ambiguous.</i>

              By  default the Midnight Commander pops up all pos-
              sible completions if the completion is ambiguous if
              you  press <b>M-Tab</b> for the second time, for the first
              time it just completes as much as possible  and  in
              the case of ambiguity beeps. If you want to see all
              the possible completions already after the first <b>M-</b>
              <b>Tab</b> pressing, set this option to 1.

       <i>torben</i><b>_</b><i>fj</i><b>_</b><i>mode</i>

              If  this  flag  is  set, then the home and end keys
              will work slightly different on the panels, instead
              of moving the selection to the first and last files
              in the panels, they will act as follows:

              The home key will: Go up to  the  middle  line,  if
              below  it;  else  go  to  the top line unless it is
              already on the top line, in this case it will go to
              the first file in the panel.

              The  end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the
              middle line, if over it; else go to the bottom line
              unless  you already are at the bottom line, in such
              case it will move the selection to  the  last  file
              name in the panel.

       <i>highlight</i><b>_</b><i>mode</i>  By  default all information on panels dis-
       played with the same color. If this variable is set to  1,
       then  <i>perm</i> or <i>mode</i> tokens in display format get ability to
       show access rights of the user to the shown  file.  Appro-
       priate  triplet  of  reading, writing and execution rights
       highlighted with the yellow ( <i>selected</i> ) color.  In  addi-
       tion,  if  the  variable is equal to 2, then all lines are
       displaying by the color according to their type (see  Col-
       ors).  Permissions highlighting also works in this mode.

       <i>use</i><b>_</b><i>file</i><b>_</b><i>to</i><b>_</b><i>guess</i><b>_</b><i>type</i>

              If  this variable is on (the default) it will spawn
              the file command to match the file types listed  on
              the mc.ext file.

       <i>xterm</i><b>_</b><i>mode</i>

              If  this  variable  is on (default is off) when you
              browse the file system on a  Tree  panel,  it  will
              automatically  reload the other panel with the con-
              tents of the selected directory.

Terminal databases
       The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix  your  system

                         20 October 1997                       47

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

       terminal  database without requiring root privileges.  The
       Midnight Commander searches in the  system  initialization
       file  (the  mc.lib  file located in the Midnight Commander
       library directory) or in the ~/.mc/ini file for  the  sec-
       tion  "terminal:your-terminal-name"  and then for the sec-
       tion "terminal:general", each line of the section contains
       a key symbol that you want to define, followed by an equal
       sign and the definition for the key.  You can use the spe-
       cial  \E form to represent the escape character and the ^x
       to represent the control-x character.

       The possible key symbols are:

       f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
       bs         backspace
       home          home key
       end           end key
       up            up arrow key
       down          down arrow key
       left          left arrow key
       right         right arrow key
       pgdn          page down key
       pgup          page up key
       insert        the insert character
       delete        the delete character
       complete      to do completion

       For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [
       + O + p, you set this in the ini file:

       insert=\E[Op

       The  <i>complete</i>  key  symbol represents the escape sequences
       used to invoke the completion  process,  this  is  invoked
       with  M-tab,  but you can define other keys to do the same
       work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused  keys
       everywhere).

<H2>FILES</H2>
       The  program will retrieve all of its information relative
       to the MCHOME environment variable, if  this  variable  is
       not set, then it will fall back to the @prefix@ directory.

       @prefix@/lib/mc.hlp

              The help file for the program.

       @prefix@/lib/mc/mc.ext

              ~/.mc/ini file.

              Global settings for the Midnight  Commander.   Set-
              tings  in this file are global to any Midnight Com-
              mander, it is useful to define site-global terminal
              settings.

       ~/.mc/ini

              User's  own setup. If this file is present then the
              setup is loaded from here instead  of  the  system-
              wide startup file.

       @prefix@/lib/mc/mc.hint

              This file contains the hints (cookies) displayed by
              the program.

       @prefix@/lib/mc/mc.menu

              This file contains the default system-wide applica-
              tions menu.

       ~/.mc/menu

              User's  own  application menu. If this file is pre-
              sent it is used instead of the system-wide applica-
              tions menu.

       ~/.mc/tree

              The  directory list for the directory tree and tree
              view features.  Each line is one entry.  The  lines
              starting with a slash are full directory names. The
              lines starting with a number have that many charac-
              ters  equal  to the previous directory. If you want
              you may create this  file  by  giving  the  command
              "find  /  -type d -print | sort &gt; ~/.mc.tree". Nor-
              mally there is no sense in  doing  it  because  the
              Midnight  Commander automatically updates this file
              for you.

       ./.mc.menu

                         20 October 1997                       49

mc(1)                                                       mc(1)

              Local user-defined menu. If this file is present it
              is used instead of the home or system-wide applica-
              tions menu.
