	* gtkedit/edit.c: Workarround for the CR/LF Translation problem.
	This is vital, because otherwise CoolEdit corrupts files -
	they keep growing each time you save the file.

	* pc/key_nt.c: fixed the problem with the AltGr Key and the
	Gray Keys. Still not optimal, but usable.
	Especially usefull for international keyboard

	* pc/util_nt.c: Provide a mc_doublepopen and mc_doublepclose
	function. If one has an egrep.exe installed it's now possible
	to search for files containing a search pattern.
